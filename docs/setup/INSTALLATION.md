# Installation
Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')

# Manual Installation
If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create a new Java project
- Copy and paste all files into the project project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose the appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src

# Troubleshooting
Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with JDK 1.6, and 1.7)
